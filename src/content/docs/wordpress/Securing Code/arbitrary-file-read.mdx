## Introduction

This article covers ways to secure the code from Arbitrary File Read vulnerability. This includes applying a proper function to check for the user's input.

## How to secure

In general, we recommend never allowing users to fully control the path to the local files that will be viewed. Also, always put a prefix and a suffix value in the formatted value that can be partially controlled by the users.

Since reading local files is a sensitive action in the first place, it should be protected by some kind of permission and a nonce check. We can also try to limit what files are being viewed using a whitelist or regex check and also the `sanitize_file_name` function to prevent path traversal when reading local files:

```php
add_action("wp_ajax_get_file", "ajax_get_file_2");

public function ajax_get_file_2(){
    global $wp_filesystem;

    check_ajax_referer("get_file");

    if(!current_user_can("manage_options")){
        die();
    }

    // Make sure that the above variable is properly setup.
    require_once ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/file.php';
    WP_Filesystem();

    $filename = sanitize_file_name($_GET["filename"]);
    $upload_dir   = wp_upload_dir();
    $file = $upload_dir['basedir'] . '/block-test/' . $filename . '.json'
    $data = $wp_filesystem->get_contents($file);
    $data = json_encode( $data );
    echo $data;
    die();
}
```
