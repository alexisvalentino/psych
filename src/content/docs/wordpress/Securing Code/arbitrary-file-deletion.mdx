## Introduction

This article covers ways to secure the code from Arbitrary File Deletion vulnerability. This includes applying a proper function to check for the user's input.

## How to secure

In general, we recommend never allowing users to fully control the path to the files or directories that will be deleted. Also, always put a prefix and a suffix value in the formatted value that can be partially controlled by the users.

Since file or directory deletion is a sensitive action in the first place, it should be protected by some kind of permission and nonce check also. We can also try to limit what files are being deleted using some kind of whitelist or regex check and also the `sanitize_file_name` function to prevent path traversal when deleting files or directories:

```php
add_action("init", "rest_init_setup");

function check_permission(){
    return current_user_can("manage_options");
}

function rest_init_setup_2(){
    register_rest_route( "myplugin/v1", '/deletetxt/', array(
        'methods'                   =>  "POST",
        'callback'                  =>  'delete_media_test_txt_2',
        'permission_callback' => 'check_permission',
    ) );
}

function delete_media_test_txt_2($request){
    $args = json_decode($request->get_body(),true);
    $data = array('status'=>false);
    $upload_dir   = wp_upload_dir();
    $file_name = sanitize_file_name($args['media']['file']);
    $file = $upload_dir['basedir'] . '/testing/' . $file_name . '.txt'

    if(!empty($file_name) ){
        wp_delete_file( $file );
        $data = array('status'=>true);
    }
    return new WP_REST_Response( $data, 200 );
}
```
