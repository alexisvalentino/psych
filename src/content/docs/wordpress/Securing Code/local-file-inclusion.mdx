## Introduction

This article covers cases of possible ways to secure the code from Local File Inclusion vulnerability on WordPress. This includes applying a proper function to check for the user's input.

## How to secure

In general, do not allow users to fully control string passed to the these functions:

- [`include`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php)
- [`include_once`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include-once.php)
- [`require`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.require.php)
- [`require_once`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.require-once.php)

In some cases, where users can supply part of the string passed to above functions, make sure to apply a proper limitation. The most ideal way to secure the code is using a whitelist check on what `.php` files can be included by the users. Make sure to also directly put a `.php` string at the end of the formatted string, so users only able to include a `.php` files and not other files.

Example implementation:

```php
add_action("init", "load_template_public");

function load_template_public(){
    $template = $_GET["template"];
    $allowed = array("sun", "moon", "water", "earth", "ocean");

    if(in_array($template, $allowed)){
        include __DIR__ . "/public/templates/{$template}.php";
    }
}
```

Some cases where users are allowed to include all of `.php` files inside a directory, applying a standard sanitization using `sanitize_file_name` function could also works.

Example implementation:

```php
add_action("init", "load_template_public");

function load_template_public(){
    $template = $_GET["template"];
    $template = sanitize_file_name($template);

    include __DIR__ . "/public/templates/{$template}.php";
}
```
