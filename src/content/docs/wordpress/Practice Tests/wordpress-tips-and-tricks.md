## Test 4

[AP Psychology Test - Developmental Psychology](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehZbdtCgldRIpWU9yWW2CFeYj43UCtIR8aNCLNnnPdiKdCqg/viewform?usp=sf_link) assesses students' understanding of the psychological growth and changes that occur throughout the human lifespan. Topics include physical, cognitive, and social development from infancy to old age. Key concepts covered in this section include theories of development (e.g., Piaget’s stages of cognitive development, Erikson’s psychosocial stages), attachment styles, the impact of parenting, and the influence of culture on development. Students will also explore developmental milestones, moral reasoning, and the nature versus nurture debate. This practice test helps students reinforce their knowledge of human development and prepares them for related questions on the AP Psychology exam.
