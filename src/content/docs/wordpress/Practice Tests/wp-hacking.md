## Test 2

[Social Psychology Practice Test](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqE0Wtww7m3pVLvwE4rjGnbKHYMIXDBgyxLMJnoykPLP0TNw/viewform?usp=sf_link) helps students prepare for exams by testing knowledge on key social psychology concepts such as group dynamics, social influence, and interpersonal behavior. Topics covered may include the bystander effect, group polarization, social facilitation, and social loafing. The test may also explore how people's thoughts, feelings, and actions are influenced by others, examining questions like how relationships affect well-being, the factors that influence attraction, and how group dynamics impact helping behaviors. Itâ€™s an essential tool for understanding how social interactions shape human behavior.
