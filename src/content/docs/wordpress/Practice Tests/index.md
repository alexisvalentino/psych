## Test 1

[Treatment of Abnormal Behavior Practice Test](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrXbiOCBj8Il659_qhnPHdHR1lJ6r4nA6oqRVg1eHoljImKA/viewform?usp=sf_link) focuses on assessing students' understanding of psychological disorders, their symptoms, causes, and treatment methods. Topics covered in this section include various types of abnormal behaviors, such as mood disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder), anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, phobias), and psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia). Students will also explore therapeutic approaches, including psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and biological treatments like medication and electroconvulsive therapy. By taking this practice test, students can test their knowledge of abnormal psychology, improve their ability to diagnose and understand mental health conditions, and prepare for related questions on the AP Psychology exam.
