### Cognitive Psychology Books

**Cognitive Psychology by College of the Canyons**

Imagine your thoughts as physical entities, constantly swirling in your mind. How does the brain shift from one thought to the next so seamlessly? Despite being constantly active—perceiving, processing, planning, and remembering—you don’t consciously notice most of this brain activity. This is a core aspect of **cognition**, which includes thinking, perception, knowledge, problem-solving, judgment, language, and memory. Cognitive scientists aim to understand how we organize and use our conscious thoughts while remaining unaware of the unconscious processes that support them. (for example, Kahneman, 2011).
