## Editing an existing article

<Steps>
0. Go to the GitHub repository and check if someone hasn't already opened a similar **Pull Request**.

2. Click on the **Edit this page** button below the article or on its right side.
3. Create a **Pull Request** with your changes.
4. Relax and wait for our response.

If you're familiar with GitHub, you can go ahead and make the necessary changes directly. However, if you're unsure or prefer a simpler approach, just email your suggested changes to us at psychess@isu.edu.ph. Please include details on the article you're editing and a clear description of the changes you'd like to make.
