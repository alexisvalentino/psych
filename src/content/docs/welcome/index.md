## Hi 👋

Great to see you here and welcome to **Patchstack Academy**. 

This place, while created by [Patchstack](https://patchstack.com), is mostly maintained by you. All you amazing **security researchers** and **developers**, who are willing to spare your time to create all the content here.

## Why did we create Patchstack Academy?
Let's make it clear - we don't have any hidden agenda. We always wanted to create a space for new researchers to learn (and more experienced ones to understand WordPress quirks) because we are all into WordPress security together.

**WordPress** is an amazing CMS, but it causes some security issues ([mostly thanks to plugins](https://patchstack.com/whitepaper/state-of-wordpress-security-in-2024/)). And the more researchers there are, the more secure is the whole ecosystem.

## I'm here to learn 🧪
That's great - check out the **sidebar menu**(it's on the left or, if you are viewing this site on mobile, on your right) and pick the article that interests you the most. 

If you didn't find what you need - use our **search** or this article with [resources](/academy/general/resources/).

## I'm here to contribute 🖊️
That's even better. We love adding new articles here. Before you start creating or fixing anything, check out our [how to contribute](/academy/welcome/how-to-contribute/) guide.
